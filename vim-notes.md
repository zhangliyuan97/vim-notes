## Vim Golf High-Scoring and Practical Tips

Here are some tips that are not only great for Vim Golf but also useful in daily editing:

### General Commands  

1. **Remove Trailing Whitespace**  
   - **`:%s/\s\+$//`**: Removes trailing whitespace from all lines.  
   - **Shortcut**: Use `:x` (with autocmd) to save and automatically clean up whitespace.  

2. **Quickly Join Lines**  
   - **`J`**: Joins the current line with the next, adjusting spaces automatically.  
   - **Batch Join**: Use a count like `5J` to join the current line with the next 4 lines.  

3. **Efficient Search and Replace**  
   - **`:%s/foo/bar/g`**: Replace all occurrences of `foo` with `bar` in the file.  
   - **`:%s/foo/bar/gc`**: Replace with confirmation for each match.  

4. **Indent/Unindent Blocks**  
   - **`>>` / `<<`**: Indent or unindent the current line.  
   - **Visual Mode**: Select multiple lines with `V` and press `>` or `<` to adjust them.  

5. **Repeat Commands**  
   - **`.`**: Repeats the last action.  
   - **Pro Tip**: Combine with counts, e.g., `3.` repeats the last action 3 times.  

6. **Cursor Movement**  
   - **`^`**: Move to the first non-blank character of the current line.  
   - **`g;` / `g,`**: Jump between the last edited positions.  
   - **`''`**: Return to the previous cursor position.  

7. **Delete Up to a Specific Character**  
   - **`dtx`**: Deletes up to (but not including) the character `x`.  
   - **`dfx`**: Deletes up to and including the character `x`.  

8. **Edit Inside Surrounding Text**  
   - **`ci'` / `ci"`**: Change content inside single or double quotes.  
   - **`ci(` / `ci{` / `ci[`**: Change content inside parentheses, braces, or brackets.  

9. **Jump to Matching Bracket**  
   - **`%`**: Jump between matching pairs of parentheses, braces, or brackets.  

10. **Insert Repeated Text**  
    - **Macros**: Record with `q[a-z]` and stop with `q`. Replay with `@[a-z]` or use counts like `10@a`.  

11. **Fold and Unfold Code**  
    - **`za`**: Toggle fold/unfold for the current block.  
    - **`zR`**: Unfold all folds.  
    - **`zM`**: Fold everything.  

12. **Visual Mode Selections**  
    - **`vip`**: Select the entire paragraph.  
    - **`va{`**: Select everything inside and including `{}`.  

13. **Edit Across Multiple Files**  
    - **`:bufdo`**: Perform operations across all open buffers.  
      - Example: `:bufdo %s/foo/bar/g | w` replaces `foo` with `bar` in all files and saves them.  

14. **Toggle Case**  
    - **`~`**: Toggle the case of the current character.  
    - **`gUiw` / `guiw`**: Convert the current word to uppercase/lowercase.  

15. **Auto-Completion**  
    - **`Ctrl-n` / `Ctrl-p`**: Trigger word completion.  
    - **Custom Dictionary**: Use `set dictionary+=dict.txt` for better suggestions.  

### Tips to Score High in Vim Golf  
- **Leverage Counts**: Most commands accept counts, e.g., `5dd` deletes 5 lines, `10x` deletes 10 characters.  
- **Minimize Keystrokes**: Use single commands instead of combining multiple ones.  
  - Example: Use `dtx` to delete up to a character instead of `fxt` followed by `x`.  
- **Combine Actions**: Use efficient commands to chain actions, like `caw` to delete and replace a word.  
- **Macros and Registers**: Record repetitive tasks into macros to save time and reduce input.  

These tips not only help you achieve high scores in Vim Golf but also make daily editing more efficient!
